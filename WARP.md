# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

The main human-facing documentation for this project now lives in `ProjectTwo_README.md` in the repo root. It describes:
- How to set up the Python environment and required libraries.
- How to run the `20254086.py` training script to produce `20254086.npy`.
- The high-level architecture: GPT-2 model, `base.py` data helpers, training loop, and test-logits grading contract.

Warp agents should consult `ProjectTwo_README.md` for the full project overview, commands, and architecture details, and treat that file as the source of truth for repository behavior.
